# Serverless Framework Examples

Examples from talk given at the Lansing DevOps Meetup Group

## 1-business-open

DIY lambda function used in manually creating the API gateway stuff

## 2-business-open-shell

Attempt to create a shell maintained.  May not be 100% complete.  Shows that
creating these commands via CLI can be complex. Furthermore, this is not a
deterministic execution.

## 3-business-open-serverless

Uses the serverless framework to minimize our efforts and knowledge while
getting the exact same output.
